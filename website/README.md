  - It uses JSX.
  - It is made up of components.
  - It has a one-way data binding.
  - It uses a virtual DOM.
  - It has many extensions.

  - Fast: Feel quick and responsive through the Apps made in React can handle       complex updates.
  - Scalable - React performs best in the case of large programs that display a     lot of data changes.
  - Modular - Allow you to write many smaller, reusable files instead of writing    large, dense files of code. The modularity of React is an attractive solution   for JavaScript's visibility issues.
  - Flexible - React approaches differently by breaking them into components        while building user interfaces. This is incredibly important in large           applications.
  - Reusable UI components - React improves development and debugging processes.

  - HTML elements have attributes, while   JSX have properties.
  - In HTML, multiple elements can be      returned, while JSX must return one    element, which we’ll call a parent     element that wraps all other levels    of nested elements.
  - In HTML almost all tags have an        opening and a closing tag except       probably a few like  <br/>, while in   JSX, however, any element can be       written as a self-closing tag, for     example: <div/>.

   - JSX is not a valid JavaScript as they are embedded in HTML elements. As JSX is combination of HTML and JavaScript it is not supported by Browsers. So, if any file contains JSX file, Babel transpiler converts the JSX into JavaScript objects which becomes a valid JavaScript. Thus, browsers understands the code and executes. Browsers can’t read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand them. JSX is not intended to be implemented by the engines or browsers, it is intended to be used by various transpilers to transform these JSX into valid JavaScript code.
